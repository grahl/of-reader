## Summary  

OFReader allows you to query an OmniFocus (TM) 2 SQLite database with ease through the command line. This tool is useful for people who use OmniFocus in their daily lives but also work on Linux machines and sometimes need information contained in OmniFocus.

## Requirements

## Installation

- Install composer
- composer install
- If you want your database to live elsewhere than $HOME/OmniFocusDatabase2 use config.yml to define your custom location (see config.yml.default).

## Todos

- Provide search capabilities
- Improve output options
- Support contexts 
- Support perspectives
- Add unit tests

I do not plan on adding write-support to this project, if you want to do so, consider forking this project. Otherwise, merge requests and feedback are very welcome.
