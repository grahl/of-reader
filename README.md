## Summary  

OFReader allows you to query an OmniFocusâ„¢ 2 SQLite database with ease through the command line. This tool is useful for people who use OmniFocus in their daily lives but also work on Linux machines and sometimes need information contained in OmniFocus.

## Installation


### Requirements

- Install composer
- Get dependencies: composer install

### Configuration

You need access to your OmniFocusDatabase2. It is not recommended to directly access your database, instead use a copy created by a cron job or LaunchAgent. You can find your database usually at `/Users/$USER/Library/Containers/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus2/Data/Library/Caches/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus2/OmniFocusDatabase2`.

The default location for the database is $HOME/OmniFocusDatabase2, use config.yml to define your custom location (see config.yml.default).

If your database is on another system, you can start with docs/sync-omnifocus.plist to upload it to a remote host.


## Usage

`./OFReader list (due|all|open|available) (--full)`
